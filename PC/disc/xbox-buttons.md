## PC (Disc Copy) Download Instructions:
### If you have already successfully installed another version of our mod before, you can skip to step 4
1) Before using the mod, you must install RPCS3. You can find the [quickstart guide to set up the emulator here](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart). If you have any questions about RPCS3 in general such as good settings to use, feel free to ask in the [official RPCS3 Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Af7H9yp).
2) If you have set up RPCS3 before, delete your `games.yml` file in your RPCS3 folder. If you are setting up RPCS3 for the first time, you can skip this step.
3) Make sure your game folder is named **EXACTLY** `BLUS31159-[NCAA Football 14]` or else the Easy Installer will not work. Then, open up your RPCS3 folder and place your game folder in `dev_hdd0/disc/`. The result should look exactly like this when you open your game folder:

4) Next, download the Easy Installer PKG:
  - [**PC Disc (~6GB)**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/kpm6zfeh5lzjra8/CFBR_PC_DISC_XB_EASY_INSTALLER_V20.1.pkg/file)

5) Finally, simply launch RPCS3 and drag the PKG file you just downloaded into the main RPCS3 window. It will take a few minutes to install. You will know it worked if the game icon changes to a CFBR logo and [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/JGcJmNB.png). After that, launch the game and enjoy the mods!
